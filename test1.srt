00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
[Speaker 1] Hmm.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
[Speaker 2] It's really beautiful.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, yes, it is. But but it's very difficult to keep clean.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
[Speaker 2] Sorry. Not a good start.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
[Speaker 1] Don't worry.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
[Speaker 2] Your accent is very clear. Where are you from?

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
[Speaker 1] I'm from Oxford.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
[Speaker 2] Wow, Oxford. 100% English.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
[Speaker 1] Yes. And you are American. Is that right?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
[Speaker 2] Yes. But my family is from Italy, Bologna.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, Italy is wonderful. My sister is in Italy at the moment.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
[Speaker 2] Where?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
[Speaker 1] She's in Rome, studying Italian painters. She's really happy. Italians are so friendly. Oh, that's Alice.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
[Speaker 3] Hi.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000

[Speaker 3] I'm from Sydney, in Australia. And you are a Capricorn.

[Speaker 2] Yes! Amazing! I come from America. I'm from New York.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
[Speaker 3] Wow, the big Apple.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
[Speaker 2] Yes. Okay. Um, can I put my things in the bedroom?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
[Speaker 1] Let me help you.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
[Speaker 3] Hey, this is nice.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
[Speaker 2] I'm glad you like it. It's a Mexican hat.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
[Speaker 3] You look great.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
[Speaker 3] And what is this?

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
[Speaker 2] It's an African mask.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
[Speaker 3] Is it magic?

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
[Speaker 2] Of course. But look at this.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
[Speaker 2] A bottle of Italian wine. Do you like wine?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
[Speaker 1] Cheers.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000

[Speaker 1] By the way, you're very lucky. Look, it's raining now.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
[Speaker 2] Yes, I am lucky.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, that's my photo album there. The pictures of all my friends are in here.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, that's interesting, show me.

47

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
[Speaker 2] Her parents are from Greece?

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
[Speaker 1] Yes, they're Greek.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
[Speaker 2] Huh.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
[Speaker 1] They're from Athens.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, and who's that?

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
[Speaker 1] Uh, that's Alice.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
[Speaker 2] No, that's not Alice.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, yes it is after a party. A Halloween party.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, that's funny. And, oh, and who are they?

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
[Speaker 1] Well, uh, that's Sharon and Peter. They live in the flat near here. They're good friends.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
[Speaker 2] She's very pretty.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
[Speaker 1] Mm.

[Speaker 2] Okay, and this is Sharon.

[Speaker 4] It's a pleasure.

[Speaker 2] How are you, Sharon?

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
[Speaker 4] Fine, thanks.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, good, you're friends. But so guys, there's work in the kitchen for everyone.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
[Speaker 2] And you are a great cook.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
[Speaker 1] Thank you, Jack.

[Speaker 2] All right. Let me see the questions. What's your name?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
[Speaker 1] Are you joking?

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
[Speaker 2] Okay, okay. A N N E. And what's your family name?

77

[Speaker 1] You have to remember, this is your telephone number, too.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
[Speaker 2] You're right.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
[Speaker 2] Are you married?

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
[Speaker 1] No, I'm single.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
[Speaker 2] A pretty girl like you is still single?

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
[Speaker 1] Stop it, Jack, please.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
[Speaker 1] Yes.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
[Speaker 1] For the moment, I'm single.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
[Speaker 2] Next question, please. Where are you from?

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
[Speaker 1] Um, there are a lot of questions.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
[Speaker 2] It's for your Chinese plates.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
[Speaker 1] Okay, for the last time, I'm from England. From Oxford.

[Speaker 1] O X F O R D.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
[Speaker 2] Just joking.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
[Speaker 1] It's okay.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
[Speaker 1] What's next?

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000

[Speaker 1] I'm an employee in a publishing company.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, you're just the right person for me. I have a great love story to write.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
[Speaker 1] Oh.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
[Speaker 1] Good morning, Alice. How are you?

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
[Speaker 3] Hi, Anne. Good morning.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
[Speaker 3] I'm fine, and you?

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
[Speaker 1] Fine, thanks.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
[Speaker 1] Excuse me, where's my watch?

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
[Speaker 3] I don't know. Isn't it under the magazines?

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
[Speaker 1] No, it isn't. Are you sure?

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
[Speaker 3] Yes, I'm sure. It's not under the magazines, and and I'm late. I have an appointment at 8 o'clock.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
[Speaker 3] Maybe it's here on the table.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
[Speaker 3] No, the watch isn't here.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
[Speaker 3] Behind the apples, next to the pasta.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
[Speaker 1] Oh! There it is! Thanks Alice.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
[Speaker 3] You're welcome, Anne. Bye.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, no. It's late.

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
[Speaker 2] Alice, what time is it?

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
[Speaker 3] Just a moment.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
[Speaker 3] It's half past 7.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
[Speaker 2] Half past 7. My train is at 8 o'clock.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
[Speaker 3] Hurry up, Jack, you're late.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
[Speaker 2] Okay, okay, where are my keys?

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
[Speaker 3] They're here on the table.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, thanks, Alice. Now, another problem. Where is my sweater?

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
[Speaker 3] Maybe it's on the chair.

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
[Speaker 2] No, it isn't. Where is it?

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
[Speaker 3] Calm down, Jack. You're wearing it.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
[Speaker 2] Oh. Thanks, Alice.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
[Speaker 2] You're a lifesaver.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
[Speaker 3] Hurry up. Go, go, go.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
[Speaker 3] Too much stress. I must go back to bed again.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
[Speaker 2] Okay, okay, girls, what time is the dinner tonight at the restaurant?

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
[Speaker 1] Uh, it's at half past eight.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
[Speaker 3] Are you sure? I think it's at half past nine.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
[Speaker 2] Okay, guys, when is it?

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
[Speaker 1] I'm certain it's at 8:30. Sorry, it's at 9:30.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
[Speaker 2] Okay, okay, it's tonight, right?

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
[Speaker 3] Yes, it's tonight. But what time is it, by the way?

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
[Speaker 2] The clock over there, it's at a quarter to 7.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
[Speaker 3] So if it's after 6, Sharon's at home.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
[Speaker 2] No, she isn't. She's at work.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
[Speaker 3] No, usually she comes back home after 6.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
[Speaker 1] Hi Sharon. Good evening.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
[Speaker 4] Hi guys.

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
[Speaker 1] Sharon, please help us. What time is the dinner tonight?

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
[Speaker 4] It's quite late, it's at half past ten.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
[Speaker 1] See, Jack, half past ten.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
[Speaker 2] Okay, you're right, I'm wrong.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
[Speaker 2] Women.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
[Speaker 4] Hello, Anne.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, it's you, Peter. Look. This is it!

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
[Speaker 4] Look at what?

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
[Speaker 1] My office. Here, near my bed.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
[Speaker 4] Oh, I see.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
[Speaker 4] By the way, where are the office supplies?

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:26,000
[Speaker 1] The computer supplies are in that cupboard over there. The folders, pencils, pens, etc. are here in this cupboard. And I also have two chairs.

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
[Speaker 4] Oh, good, at least for everyone.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
[Speaker 1] No, they are not. Don't touch anything, please.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
[Speaker 4] Okay, so you say you have all of the office supplies?

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
[Speaker 1] No, not really. Um, there isn't a fax machine.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
[Speaker 1] There aren't all the programs I need on my computer.

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
[Speaker 4] And I guess you have an answering machine. Is it useful?

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
[Speaker 1] I don't need an answering machine. I answer the telephone myself.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
[Speaker 4] Okay, you're right. This office is nice.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
[Speaker 4] And if you need a fax machine, I have one in my apartment.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, thank you.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
[Speaker 4] Wait a minute. Something is missing. Where's the coffee machine? All offices have a coffee machine.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
[Speaker 1] I'm afraid there isn't one here. There's a staff kitchen on the other side of the house. In the kitchen.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
[Speaker 1] We can have some coffee there.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
[Speaker 4] Good idea.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
[Speaker 1] Do you want milk with your coffee? There's a bottle in the back of the fridge.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
[Speaker 4] I prefer it without milk, but with some sugar.

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, I'm afraid there isn't any sugar.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
[Speaker 4] Well, that's okay. Black coffee is good too.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
[Speaker 4] Do you have any of those great cookies?

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
[Speaker 1] Oh, yes.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,000
[Speaker 1] There are some cookies over here.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
[Speaker 4] Peter speaking.

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
[Speaker 4] What?

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
[Speaker 4] An audition.

191
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
[Speaker 4] No, not at all.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
[Speaker 4] I'm free. Great.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
[Speaker 4] Bye.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
[Speaker 4] Well, finally, an audition.

195
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
[Speaker 1] Wonderful! When?

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
[Speaker 4] Next Monday, at the Opera Theater. These cookies are fantastic. Are there any more?

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
[Speaker 1] There are some more in the box.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
[Speaker 4] Thank you. Bye, Ann. Time for music.

199
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
[Speaker 1] Hey! Take your dirty napkin away from my kitchen!

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
[Speaker 1] Mmm!

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
[Speaker 4] Oh.

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:00,000
[Speaker 1] Yes. I always go shopping on Saturdays. The first thing I do on Saturday is drive to the supermarket.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:09,000
[Speaker 3] I sometimes go shopping on Saturdays, but usually I sleep late. I'm always so tired on Saturdays.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
[Speaker 1] I'm never tired on the weekend. The weekend is a time for fun. I paint, go jogging, go out with some friends.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
[Speaker 1] Unfortunately, I sometimes have to study.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
[Speaker 3] Oh, I sometimes do a little work at the weekend.

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:44,000
[Speaker 3] When I'm free, I like going swimming, going to exhibitions or to concerts if I have enough money. Oh, and every Sunday, I clean up the entire flat.

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
[Speaker 3] And in the evening, I watch TV.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
[Speaker 4] Oh, I never watch TV. It's boring.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
[Speaker 4] Peter and I like going to the cinema at the weekend.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
[Speaker 2] Yes, it's important not to watch too much TV. An hour a day or so, that's enough.

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
[Speaker 1] Come on, guys. You talk like my grandfather. Work, TV, housework on the weekends? Life is more.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
[Speaker 2] I want you to take me to places where young people have fun.

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
[Speaker 1] Great. Get ready, Grandpa.

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:33,000
[Speaker 2] Work is so hard, guys. I wake up at 6:30 every day. Have breakfast and take the train to work. Every day.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
[Speaker 1] I know. I get up at 7:00, but I have a friend at work who usually gets up at 6:00.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
[Speaker 2] Why? That's too early.

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
[Speaker 1] It takes him an hour to drive to work.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
[Speaker 2] Wow. That's a long drive.

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
[Speaker 1] Yes. But he lives in the country. I think he's lucky.

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
[Speaker 1] Every weekend he can go for walks in the woods. Not in traffic jams.

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:14,000
[Speaker 2] I guess that's pretty nice. He lives in the countryside, but works in the city. A pretty nice combination.

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
[Speaker 1] What about you, Sharon? What time do you wake up?

224
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
[Speaker 4] I usually get up at about 9:00. But I live in the city. It's easy to get to work.

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
[Speaker 2] Yes, but you get home very late. Often 6:30 or 7:00.

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
[Speaker 4] You know, I sometimes have five or six groups of tourists a day.

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
[Speaker 2] You work too much, my dear.

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
[Speaker 4] And you sing too much, Peter.

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,000
[Speaker 2] Alice, I bet you don't wake up at 6:00 every day. Tell us something about your typical day at university.

230
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
[Speaker 3] Well, I sometimes have classes in the morning, but I usually have classes in the afternoon. On Mondays, I always attend lectures in the morning.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
[Speaker 2] And where do you study?

232
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
[Speaker 3] I usually study in the library, but I sometimes study at home, too, when I don't have classes in the morning.

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
[Speaker 2] My friend David also studies at your university. Do you remember him?

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
[Speaker 3] David Leary?

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
[Speaker 3] Yes, I occasionally see him in the library and sometimes in the park.

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
[Speaker 2] In the park? Doing what?

237
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
[Speaker 3] He likes studying there. He takes his books, finds a nice park bench and reads there.

238
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
[Speaker 2] Not a bad idea. You can study and enjoy nature at the same time.

239
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
[Speaker 3] Yes, I like the park, too. Unfortunately, I often need books that are in the library.

240
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
[Speaker 2] And what about lunch? Do you usually make sandwiches and take them with you?

241
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
[Speaker 3] Oh, no. I hate cooking. I usually have lunch in the cafeteria with friends.

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
[Speaker 4] Oh, I do just the opposite. I usually cook lunch at home. I seldom have a quick lunch at coffee shops.

243
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:31,000
[Speaker 2] Okay, guys. Stop with this boring talk. What about fun? Do any of you do anything besides working and studying? It's Friday, remember?

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
[Speaker 3] You're right, Jack. I'm so happy it's Friday.

245
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
[Speaker 2] Me too. It's weekend time.

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
[Speaker 1] Time for shopping!

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
[Speaker 2] May I ask you a question, Alice?

248
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
[Speaker 3] Sure. Ask any question you like. I'm an open book.

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
[Speaker 2] Do you have a boyfriend?

250
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:07,000
[Speaker 3] Well, I go out with some boys, but that's nothing serious. According to my birth chart, I need some Taurians. But that's not easy now that Saturn is in Leo.

251
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
[Speaker 2] I see. Anyway, I think you have a strange relationship with boys.

252
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
[Speaker 3] Oh, no. I like boys very much. They're great at carrying packages.

253
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
[Speaker 2] You're exceptional.

254
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:32,000
[Speaker 3] Thanks, Jack. But now, stop talking about me. Let's talk about you. What do you think of me?

255
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
[Speaker 3] No, really. I'm curious. What do you do at work?

256
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, nothing special. Um, you know Speedmaster, the sporting goods factory.

257
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
[Speaker 3] Yeah, sure, they produce wonderful running shoes. What department do you work in?

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
[Speaker 2] I'm a sales manager. Last month they gave me a promotion and now I'm responsible for Southern Europe. That's why I moved here.

259
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
[Speaker 3] Wow, that's really interesting. You must be very good at work. What exactly do you do?

260
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, basically, I look for new clients and keep them informed about new product lines and take care of their requests.

261
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
[Speaker 3] What kind of requests do they have?

262
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, they often ask questions about new models and prices.

263
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
[Speaker 3] What do you do if they want a discount?

264
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:32,000
[Speaker 2] Well, basically, I don't get mad. I listen to them and then I tell them, no. Well, seriously speaking, it depends. Each client is different. If they're important, I try to make an agreement with them.

265
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
[Speaker 2] Hi, Anne. Hi, Sharon. Where's Peter?

266
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
[Speaker 4] Oh, Peter's preparing his audition.

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
[Speaker 2] Well, tell Peter I wish him good luck.

268
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
[Speaker 4] Do you really care?

269
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, girls, we're talking about jobs. Tell me about your job, Sharon. What do you do at the moment?

270
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
[Speaker 4] Ah, that's an interesting question.

271
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
[Speaker 2] Really? Why do you say that?

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
[Speaker 4] Well, you know I have a degree in archaeology, but now I'm doing something quite different.

273
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
[Speaker 2] Do you have a part-time job?

274
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
[Speaker 4] No, unfortunately, it's a full-time job. I work for a travel agency.

275
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, what do you do?

276
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
[Speaker 4] I give tours around the city. I bring tourists to monuments and museums, and other interesting places.

277
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
[Speaker 2] Well, that's nice.

278
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
[Speaker 2] Could I have you as a tour guide for one day?

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
[Speaker 4] I'm sorry. I only work with groups. Usually with Japanese people.

280
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, well, I'm a black belt in karate.

281
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
[Speaker 4] Very funny, but it's not enough.

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
[Speaker 2] It's too bad.

283
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
[Speaker 2] Anne, stop cleaning for a moment. Sit down and tell me about your job.

284
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
[Speaker 1] Okay, okay, okay, okay.

285
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
[Speaker 1] I work in a publishing company.

286
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
[Speaker 2] Oh, so you work with famous writers?

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
[Speaker 1] Not exactly. Um, I don't work with the writers. I just read their proofs and correct them before printing.

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
[Speaker 4] Ah, by the way, do you know Paul Taylor? He works with you, right?

289
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
[Speaker 1] Yes, yes, but we don't work in the same department. He works in the advertising department.

290
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
[Speaker 1] But we are good friends. Every weekend we play tennis together.

291
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
[Speaker 2] I play tennis. I'm jealous. Do you play tennis too? Do you want to play with us?

292
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
[Speaker 1] Do you play tennis too? Do you want to play with us?

293
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
[Speaker 2] Well, just joking. I don't play tennis that well. Only karate.

294
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
[Speaker 3] I am beautiful. Don't say I beautiful. I am beautiful. I am in short form, you can say, on or you can say I'm, okay? So I am, I'm. So you can say I'm beautiful. I'm beautiful. Number two, I'm busy. Or you can say, I am busy. Remember, in writing, we cannot use short form like this. Okay? We have to use I am beautiful. When you, when it comes to speaking, you can say, I am beautiful or, I'm beautiful. In speaking, people just want to say quickly, so they usually use short form. I'm. So, I'm beautiful. I'm busy for speaking, but for writing, we use I am beautiful and I am busy. Okay? So remember, I with am. Now, number three. He is crazy. He is crazy. He is, we can say he's. So, you can say he's crazy. He's crazy. He's crazy. Now, number four. You can say in short form, he's handsome. He's handsome. Or he is handsome. Remember, in writing, we have to write, he is crazy. He is handsome. Number seven and number eight. It is sunny. So, as you can see, it go with is. Okay? It is sunny. In short form, we can say, It is it's. So you can say, it's sunny. It's sunny. Number eight, it's great. It's great. You are happy. You are attractive. For writing, for speaking, your. You're happy. You're attractive. Number 13 and number 14. We are sad. So, we go with R too. We are sad. Sad that means unhappy. We are sad. Now, we are in short form, we can say, we're. We're. Number 15 and number 16. They are excited. So, you can see they goes with R. They are. They are excited. Excited just like happy. Uh, they are. They are excited. They are, in short form, you can write, sorry, you can say, there. There. Just like over there. There.

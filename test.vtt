2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Thanks everyone for coming to this project meeting. I know we're all working cross-functionally on this project, but so far the key stakeholders are really pleased with how it's going. This project will really benefit our overall value proposition and the company as a whole.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Thanks, John. It's an important project. It's good to be collaborating on this together.

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes, it's important, but we're also busy with our regular jobs. It would be difficult to fit things in.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Speaker 2>It's okay, Mateo. We'll work it out. I know that you all have a lot on at the moment, combining this project with your regular jobs.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Speaker 3>So, what do we need to do and by when?

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Good questions, Barbara. We have a number of key deliverables to discuss, so it's essential we're all in agreement about roles and responsibilities, and also the timelines we're working to.

8
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Great.

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes, it's good to get this clear.

10
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 2>So, the first thing we need to do is design the customer survey questionnaire. In my experience, this is best done through an online survey tool.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a great idea. I'm glad you have experience with this.

12
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, we've done something similar on previous projects.

13
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
<v Speaker 5>So, will you do that, John?

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to, but I'm already tied up managing this project, and my line manager Kate has agreed that I should focus on the timelines, reporting, and financial management. I'd like A Kiko to lead on the questionnaire. You learned about this on your marketing and PR course, didn't you?

15
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah. Happy to take it on.

16
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Thanks, Akiko. Next thing is we need the new designs finalized. Mateo, you said you could do this in a couple of weeks, right?

17
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah, I know, but that was last month, and then nothing happened. I'm overloaded at the moment and my line manager won't be happy if I don't hit my targets. Sorry, but this project has to take lower priority.

18
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Hmm. I see. I can understand the challenge you're facing. I've been in that situation before. So, what can we do to help you hit those targets and free up some time?

19
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Sorry, but this project has to take lower priority.

20
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question. If I could get a slight reduction in my targets, I could use the extra time that would create to finish the designs for this project.

21
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay. We might not be able to get your targets reduced, but I'll see what we can do.

22
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 3>How about if I support Matea there? I know his job well and I have some capacity at the moment. I can help him meet his targets so he can free up some time to finish the designs for this project.

23
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Could you, Barbara? Hmm. I'm not sure if it's fair to ask Barbara to be supporting Mateo in his regular job so he can work on this project.

24
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 3>It's up to you, but I'm happy to support Mateo with his regular work just for a couple of weeks so he can create the designs. He's the only one with the expertise.

25
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, you're right. Okay. Thanks a lot, Barbara. I appreciate it. Mateo, would that work for you?

26
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes, that would work. Thanks. Okay, you've made it easy for me to say yes.

27
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay, then that's settled. Thanks both. I really appreciate your help in this. So, can you get them done by the end of the month?

28
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes, that should be no problem.
